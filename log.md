# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 0: January 11, 2019 **

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Github and added some Codepen projects as Gists, signed up to twitter to tweet my progress and connect with others taking the challenge!

**Thoughts**: I'm excitied to get started in my coding journey in ernest. After already completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification I'm now ready to take on JavaScript!

**Day 1: January 12, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, focused on spread and rest operators and using these with destructuring assingments for arrays and objects.

**Thoughts**: I'm finding JavaScript hard work to get my head around - especially using ES6; the "longer" versions of code in ES5 make more sense to me than the "shorthand" of ES6, however I am sure with more practice things will click into place. I think I need more practice in context i.e. building an app using JavaScript.

**Day 2: January 13, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, learning about constructor functions to create objects and manipulating objects with getters and setters 

**Thoughts**: I still don't understand 100% getters and setters but these will come up further down the line, again context and using them to build an application might help them make more sense. One day at a time!

**Day 3: January 14, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ES6 section in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification. Sarter reading Jon Duckett's JavaSCript and JQuery book - finished chapter 1 plus exercise c01 using atom. 

**Thoughts**: Jon Duckett's book has provided the context about how JS fits in with HTML and CSS - I have a much better sense of how it all fits together to create an interactive, respnsive web page and am excited to continue reading. I think I have some catching up to do before going on to the next section in freeCodeCamp.

**Day 4: January 15, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 of Jon Duckett's book (basic javascript instructions) and worked through most of the "regular expressions" section on freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts**: The book continues to be clear and chapter 2 was a revision and clarification of basic JavaScript I had gone over in freeCodeCamp. Regular Expressions make sense - just about learning the vocab and snytax!

**Day 5: January 16, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Started chapter 3 of JavaScipt textbook, reading about functions, and completed the debugging section in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts**: Re-reading about functions gives me more confidence that I know how to declare and write basic ones - looking froward to the book explaining more about methods and function expressions etc. Debugging seems quite common sense, always need to check spellings, brackets etc and use console.log to check variables as you go along!
