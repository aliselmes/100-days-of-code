# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 0: January 11, 2019 **

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Github and added some Codepen projects as Gists, signed up to twitter to tweet my progress and connect with others taking the challenge!

**Thoughts**: I'm excitied to get started in my coding journey in ernest. After already completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification I'm now ready to take on JavaScript!

**Day 1: January 12, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, focused on spread and rest operators and using these with destructuring assingments for arrays and objects.

**Thoughts**: I'm finding JavaScript hard work to get my head around - especially using ES6; the "longer" versions of code in ES5 make more sense to me than the "shorthand" of ES6, however I am sure with more practice things will click into place. I think I need more practice in context i.e. building an app using JavaScript.

**Day 2: January 13, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, learning about constructor functions to create objects and manipulating objects with getters and setters 

**Thoughts**: I still don't understand 100% getters and setters but these will come up further down the line, again context and using them to build an application might help them make more sense. One day at a time!
