# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 0: January 11, 2019 **

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Github and added some Codepen projects as Gists, signed up to twitter to tweet my progress and connect with others taking the challenge!

**Thoughts**: I'm excitied to get started in my coding journey in ernest. After already completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification I'm now ready to take on JavaScript!

**Day 1: January 12, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, focused on spread and rest operators and using these with destructuring assingments for arrays and objects.

**Thoughts**: I'm finding JavaScript hard work to get my head around - especially using ES6; the "longer" versions of code in ES5 make more sense to me than the "shorthand" of ES6, however I am sure with more practice things will click into place. I think I need more practice in context i.e. building an app using JavaScript.

**Day 2: January 13, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, learning about constructor functions to create objects and manipulating objects with getters and setters 

**Thoughts**: I still don't understand 100% getters and setters but these will come up further down the line, again context and using them to build an application might help them make more sense. One day at a time!

**Day 3: January 14, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ES6 section in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification. Sarter reading Jon Duckett's JavaSCript and JQuery book - finished chapter 1 plus exercise c01 using atom. 

**Thoughts**: Jon Duckett's book has provided the context about how JS fits in with HTML and CSS - I have a much better sense of how it all fits together to create an interactive, respnsive web page and am excited to continue reading. I think I have some catching up to do before going on to the next section in freeCodeCamp.

**Day 4: January 15, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 of Jon Duckett's book (basic javascript instructions) and worked through most of the "regular expressions" section on freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts**: The book continues to be clear and chapter 2 was a revision and clarification of basic JavaScript I had gone over in freeCodeCamp. Regular Expressions make sense - just about learning the vocab and snytax!
