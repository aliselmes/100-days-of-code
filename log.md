# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 0: January 11, 2019 **

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Github and added some Codepen projects as Gists, signed up to twitter to tweet my progress and connect with others taking the challenge!

**Thoughts**: I'm excitied to get started in my coding journey in ernest. After already completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification I'm now ready to take on JavaScript!

**Day 1: January 12, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, focused on spread and rest operators and using these with destructuring assingments for arrays and objects.

**Thoughts**: I'm finding JavaScript hard work to get my head around - especially using ES6; the "longer" versions of code in ES5 make more sense to me than the "shorthand" of ES6, however I am sure with more practice things will click into place. I think I need more practice in context i.e. building an app using JavaScript.

**Day 2: January 13, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, learning about constructor functions to create objects and manipulating objects with getters and setters 

**Thoughts**: I still don't understand 100% getters and setters but these will come up further down the line, again context and using them to build an application might help them make more sense. One day at a time!

**Day 3: January 14, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ES6 section in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification. Sarter reading Jon Duckett's JavaSCript and JQuery book - finished chapter 1 plus exercise c01 using atom. 

**Thoughts**: Jon Duckett's book has provided the context about how JS fits in with HTML and CSS - I have a much better sense of how it all fits together to create an interactive, respnsive web page and am excited to continue reading. I think I have some catching up to do before going on to the next section in freeCodeCamp.

**Day 4: January 15, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 of Jon Duckett's book (basic javascript instructions) and worked through most of the "regular expressions" section on freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts**: The book continues to be clear and chapter 2 was a revision and clarification of basic JavaScript I had gone over in freeCodeCamp. Regular Expressions make sense - just about learning the vocab and snytax!

**Day 5: January 16, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Started chapter 3 of JavaScipt textbook, reading about functions, and completed the debugging section in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts**: Re-reading about functions gives me more confidence that I know how to declare and write basic ones - looking froward to the book explaining more about methods and function expressions etc. Debugging seems quite common sense, always need to check spellings, brackets etc and use console.log to check variables as you go along!

**Day 6: January 17, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Read about Objects/Arrays in Chapter 3 of JavaScript textbook to refresh my memory then worked through the array lessons in the Basic Data Structures section of feecodecamp. 

**Thoughts**: I am feeling quite comfortable using methods to modify arrays - looking forward to getting into the baisc algorithm scripting section on FCC to put these ideas into practice.

**Day 7: January 18, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Read about built-in objects in Chapter 3 of JavaScript textbook, finished the object lessons in the Basic Data Structures section of feecodecamp and started the Basic Algorithm Scripting section.

**Thoughts**: I had been using built-in objects without realising that's what they were so good again to have some context provided by the textbook. the basic algorithm's are making sense though I still need some hints - trying to not be lazy and search around for an answer before going to the hint! Lots of methods i don't know about, maybe use lodash will help?

**Day 8: January 19, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Slow going! Having to use Google a lot to get the solutions but discovering some useful built-in methods, some are a bit to complex for me right now so resorting to simple for loops / if statements makes it easier for me to follow the logic - need to think through the logic further before jumping to a hint!

**Day 9: January 20, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts**: Getting used to Googling around to find answers, coming up with more of my own ways to do things even if they don't quite work, I'm nearly getting them. Learning about more useful methods and how to apply them. Still need more practice working through the logic of a function and thinking like a computer!

**Day 10: January 21, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Object Oriented Pragramming section on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts**: I was pretty familiar with creating, accessing, and changing properties of objects but learning about inheritance, IIFE's, prototypes, mixins etc took some concentration. It did all make sense and I made extensive notes. Need a chance to see it all put together in a practical example now.

**Day 11: January 22, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Lodash Library project on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to have finished a big codeacademy project - I got the gist of recreating each method of the lodash lobrary and was able to come up with a "game pan" on how to implement each one but still needed to goolge and research to tweak bits of my code so that it worked. I feel like I've reached the same stage on Code Academny and freeCodeCamp so need to decide which one to continue with first - maybe finish off the freeCodeCamp Javascript certificate before moving on?

**Day 12: January 23, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Worked through most of the functional programming section on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: The concepts of functional programming make sense - keep everything within your function and don't let it effect variables elsewhere in the code. It was cool to discover a lot of built-in methods to use which don't mutate code anywhere else. Still getting to grips with the syntax of them and not using the "long-winded" versions e.g. for loops i'd bene using previously.

**Day 13: January 24, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Finished fucntional programming section and started the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Unluck day 13! Super frustrating day! I understand most of the concepts freeCodeCamp has taken me through but sturggle to apply them in the algorithm scripting challenges - reached the stage where I can understand and read a solution when I see it but sturggle to come up with the logic and write the solution myself! Gotta keep pushing on.

**Day 14: January 26, 2019**

**Today's Progress**: Still working through intermediate algorithm scripting on freeCodeCamp - skipped a day due to working on the farm.

**Thoughts**: Still heavily reliant on the hints to give me a clue about the logic - again I understand the solution code but struggle to implement it myself - the solutions also use lots of new methods i didn't know existed - so I guess always search for a method / function to do things for you!
